# geological-map-production-toolbox_ArcGIS
This toolbox was designed for ArcGIS 10.3, but should work in other versions. The toolbox "Geological Map Production Toolbox v1.tbx" stores relative links to the scripts (e.g. "1_create_template_geological_features_v3.py") both need to be in the same folder to work. These are the files needed to run the toolbox.
It is recommended that your file gdb be on a local disc as this speeds up arcgis processing tools.
Follow the Geology map production toolbox instructions to use the toolbox. 
I have included some sample data for testing purposes: A georeferenced map, and a file geodatabase with digitised features.
